# Spot the Fake
[**Spot the Fake**](https://spot-the-fake.herokuapp.com/) is a casual drinking game developed for a [project assignment](https://github.com/wdi-sg/wdi-16-collosal-banana/tree/master/project-2) at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) Course.

Fake news itself is nothing new, but with the advent of new technology, the internet and social media has made it cheap and easy to perpetuate. While personally I do enjoy reading the ocassional satire and clickbaits, the problem comes when one is unable to decipher fact from fiction. Fake news is dreamt up and put out to resemble credible journalism to attract maximum attention and manipulate its readers. These so called news stories can be used to push polotical agendas, spread propaganda and deceive its readers. Governments are already making a stand against fake news.

But how difficult is it to tell apart fact from fiction? I invite you to try it out for yourself [here](https://spot-the-fake.herokuapp.com/)! **Spot the Fake** is a simple game in which you are given two articles with their pictures and headlines with the goal being to spot the fake one.
